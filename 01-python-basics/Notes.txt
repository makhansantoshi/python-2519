        -> 250 GB SSD / HDD
    
    -> Softwares

        -> System Software

            -> Win / Linux / Unix(MACOS)

                -> Install Python 3.13.X (Python Interpreter)

                    -> Making our System Capable of running Python Code
                
                -> Install IDE (Integrated Development Environment) (Visual Studio Code)

                    -> For Writing Code

                    -> We have support For

                        -> Auto Code Completion

                        -> Syntax Highlighting

                        -> External Extensions Support

                    -> Client Software 

                    -> Track Source Code in your Workstation (Your Laptop)

                    -> Tracked Code will be uploaded to GitHub

        -> We need to setup GitHub Accounts 

            -> Storing Source Code

            -> Integrate GitHub Account with Git & IDE

20th Aug
========

-> How To Setup 

    -> Python
    -> IDE - VS Code
    -> Git (Git bash)
    -> GitHub
    -> Version Controlling
    -> Repository 
    -> Cloning 
    -> Pushing

    21st Aug
========

-> Write Python Code 

    -> Script Mode (100%)

        -> Using code editor 

    -> Command Line / Interactive Mode (Quick Checks) 

        -> Directly executing code on python Interpreter using 
            CLI (Command Line Interface)

    -> Syntax - Rules and guidelines 

    -> print(hello world) -- issue
    -> print(9) -- No issue

    -> 9 is literal number, it doesn't need to be defined before hand
    -> hello world is a text, which needs to be represented in single
    or double quotes

        -> print(hello world) Wrong Syntax
        -> print('hello world') Correct Syntax
    
    -> Like English has 26 alphabets, which is basis for forming 
        words and sentences
    
    -> Python has same concept, which are called as Keywords

        -> keywords + syntax = program / app

    -> import is a keyword --> imports module --> module is a .py file


22nd Aug
=============
->Identifiers
 -> within Python an Identifier is used to indentify the following

 ->Variables
 ->functions
 ->classes
 ->objects
 ->methods
 ->modules
 ->etc

 ->Rules for naming identifiers
 ->can contain
 ->Letters(a-z)(A-Z)
 ->Digits(0-9)
 ->underscore(_)

 ->Must start with 
   ->A letter (a-z, A-Z)
   ->Underscore(_)

->Note: cannot start with digits
->Note: Cannot be keywords
=>Note: Case Sensitive(Name.name, NAME) (A, a)
->Note: Always name the identifiers appropriately

-> Why Python / Key Features Of Python

    -> It's Easy (**)

        -> Syntax
        -> Execution
        -> Simplicity of language(space)  

    -> Fewer Lines Of Code (**)

        -> Addition Program in Python it's 3 lines
        -> Addition Program in Java it's 7 lines

    -> Interpreted (Python) vs Compiled (Java) (**)

        -> Performance -> Faster -> Compiled

        -> Performance -> Slower -> Interpreted

        -> Python Development Speed -> Faster 

            -> Python is best prototype language

        -> Java Development Speed -> Slower 

    -> Dynamically Typed (Python) (**)

        -> No need to explicitly define Data types

        -> Static Typed (Java), where we need to explicitly
            define the data types

    -> Vast Library (**)

    -> Scripting / Object Oriented (OOPS) / Functional (**)

    -> Open Source (Free)

    -> Robust 

    -> Platform Independent


23rd Aug
========

-> Variables

    -> Variables are names for memory locations

        -> Persistent Data (Permanent Data / Long Term Data)

            -> Hard Disk 

        -> Non-Persistent Data (Temporary Data)

            -> RAM (Memory)
    
    -> A variable allows you to 

        -> Assign Data
        -> Manipulate Data (If Required)
        -> Retrieve Data 

    -> Syntax 

        -> variable_name = value
            student_age = 25

            = Assignment operator

    -> NOTE: In Python, the type of a variable can change during execution.

    -> NOTE: A function does a task, and is represented using ()

    -> type() - what is the data type of specified variable

    -> id() - gives the memory address/location of variable

    -> NOTE: Even though a and c are different variables, 
        Python optimizes memory and may reuse the same object.
    
    -> Mutable Data : Data that can change / can be changed (Modify)

        -> Lists, Dictionaries, Sets etc

    -> Immutable Data : Data that cannot be changed (Non Modifiable)

        -> numbers, strings, tuples etc

    -> Any variable data, we can output using print() 

    -> Operator Overloading - a single operator exhibits multiple behaviors
        based on the input data given (OOPS Principle - Polymorphism)

        25th Aug
========

-> What is concatenation ? 
    -> Joining multiple Strings

-> What is interpolation ? 
    -> interpolation in programming means replacing placeholders with actual values

-> Using f-Strings (Formatted String Literals)  

    -> An f-String allows you to embed variables directly inside a string using {}

-> A variable allows you to 

        -> Assign Data
            -> Manipulate Data (If Required)
        -> Retrieve Data 


-> Operators

    -> In python, an operator is symbol which performs an operation on
        variables and values

    -> To Manipulate Data we need Operators    

    -> Types Of Operators

        -> Arithmetic Operators - Mathematical calculations
            -> + - * / % 
            -> //- floor division (same as division, but round off value)
            -> ** - exponentiation

        -> Compound Assignment Operators
            -> Python provides Operator to combine Arithmetic and Assignment Operators
            -> For concise(short hand) coding 
            -> x = x + 5 --> x += 5

        -> Comparison Operators    

            -> Used to compare values and return a boolean type(True/False) as result
            -> ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

        -> Logical Operators
            -> Used to combine multiple conditions(boolean values)
            -> and - return true, when conditions are true
            -> or - return true, at least one condition is true
            -> not - negates the boolean value, if value is true then its result false

26th August
====================

Membership Operators: It is used to test if a squence is present in the object
-> in - returns true if the sequence is present in the specified value
-> not in - returns true if the sequence is not present in the specified value.

Identity operators: used to compare the objects
-> is - returns true if both the variables are pointing to the same memory location.
-> is not - returns true if both the variables are not pointing to the same memory location

Data Type
It defines what kind of data a variable can hold.
Numeric data types
 -> Numbers with or without decimal points
 ->Integer - whole numbers 1,2,3 to -1,-2,-3
 ->float - 3.14,2.15,10.5
 ->complex - this are like maths numbers
           Math: a+ib (i-imaginary)
           Python: a+bj (j-imaginary)
->Text type: A sequence of characters between single ' ' or double "" quotes.
  NOTE: In python doex not support single character data type.

-> Boolean Type - return True or false

->sequence type - string is also a sequence
->list: Multiple values stored as a sequence, represented in [] ->Mutable(changable)
->Tuple:Multiple values stored a s sequence, represented in ()-> Immutable(can't changable)
->set type
->set: multiple values stored as a sequence, represented in {} - >unique data only 
->Frozen data : multiple values stored as a sequence, represented in {} - >unique data only and Immutable
->Dictionary(Mapping)Type: Multiple values are store as a sequence of key and value Pair, represented in {}
->None type: Represents nothing, absence of values
-> Note: All the above are predefined data types by python , we can also create our custom data types based on requirements.
->NOTE: Strings, sequence types (***)

3rd september
===========================
-> student management System

-> Type conversion & Type Casting

-> The above are used to convert from one data type to another data type

-> Type Conversion: Implicit/Automatic means python by default perform conversions when its safe and there is no data loss
-> widening : Conversion of smaller data types to larger data types

-> Type Casting: Explicit/ anually should be done by developers using built in functions
->Narrowing - Conversion of larger data types into smaller
int() - convert into integer - int(3) - 3
float() - convert into float - int(3.5) - 3.5
str() - conert into string value - str(100) - "100".
